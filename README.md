<h2>Anth241Hmwk</h2>
  
Anth241Hmwk is a package used in Anth 241 (Human Biological Anthropology) to demonstrate
the relationship between number of alleles and heterozygosity, plot a geneaological tree and
inbreeding coefficients from "Game of Thrones," various population genetic models and simulations
(including the coalescent), and Preece-Baines distance, velocity, and acceleration curves.

<b>Warning:</b> Plots are intentionally <i>not</i> sent to the RStudio plot area (lower right quarter).
Instead, they are opened in new windows.  You may have to hunt around for these windows (look for window icons)
and open them (if there are icons).  To copy the plots your best bet is to copy as bitmap and paste to your document.
Once you have copied the plot be sure to close the plot so that you do not get a plethora of plots.

<h3>To install, paste the following two lines to the R console:</h3>
install.packages('devtools')

devtools::install_github('lylewk/Anth241Hmwk',dependencies = T)
