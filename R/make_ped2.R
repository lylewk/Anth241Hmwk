#' @title Plot pedigree from Game of Thrones and calculate inbreeding coefficents
#' @description Family tree for "Jon II," the presumed son of Jon Snow (Stark) and
#' Daenerys Targaryn.
#' @details OK, I got this a few years back from what I thought was the definitive
#' family tree.  I'm not so sure now about some of the links in this tree.  There
#' are no parameters as this is just a "demo" that is "hard-wired" to draw this
#' particular tree.
#' @return Returns pedigree and inbreeding coefficients.  We will see
#' in the future that the inbreeding coefficient is the probability of
#' identity by descent (i.b.d.), the probability that the alleles are
#' the same at a locus because they were inherited from the same ancestor(s).
