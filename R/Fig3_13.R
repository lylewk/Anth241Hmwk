#' @title Plot of average relative fitness against allele frequencies.
#' @description Shows the curve of average relative fitness against allele frequencies
#' in a biallelic system under selection regimes.
#' @details
#' The object is called Fig3_13 as it is Figure 3.13 on page 74 of Mielke, Konigsberg,
#' and Relethford (2011) and on page 70 of the 2006 edition where it is Figure 3.8.
#' @param w Vector of three values giving the relative fitness for each genotype,
#' AA, AB, and BB.  As these are relative fitness values, at least one value must
#' be 1.0. Default = c(0.7635,1,0.0001)
#' @param x A vector containing two elements that give the limits for the allele
#' frequencies for the plot.  This is used to "zoom in" on the graph.  Default=c(0.65,0.95)
#' @param y A vector containing two elements that give the limits for the relative
#' fitness values for the plot.  This is used to "zoom in" on the graph.  Default=c(0.77,0.82)
#' @param tan.int A real value giving the frequency of the tangents to the curve.
#' The constraint is that 0<= tan.int <=1. Values closer to 0.0 give more tangents
#' and  values closer to 1 give fewer tangents. Default=0.01
#' @return Plot of average relative fitness against allele frequencies with tangents
#' drawn to the curve.
